                "The previous (first) question is actually another version of this question. But, in the first question, we just focused on the top 5% of the right in the bars. Therefore, the gap ratio between elements in the first question is the same as in the second question.",
                "We need to be aware that even though the ratio is the same, the second question is unmistakeably harder than the first question. This phenomenon happens due to our focus. In the first question, we just focused on the differences, so we easily differentiate the one from the others. When the reality is, the general view is in the second place. Each element is really similar to the others. Hence, we truly do not need to compare these elements as they are already doing their best."

The point is we always doubt ourselves even when we are told to not do it. Therefore, we need to have the right mindset, which is the one who pursues peace."

But, it is even harder to compare ten identical elements. To be able to compare these ten elements, we need more time and focus to do it.",
